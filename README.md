On 24th February 2022, Russia launched a full-scale military invasion on Ukraine. The conflict has the potential to be a humanitarian catastrophe.
In the 48 hours since Russia launched a full-scale invasion on Ukraine, the UN reports 120,000 people have already fled their homes. Neighboring countries are receiving refugees. Poland, for instance, has estimated that it could receive up to 1 million refugees.
In response to this crisis, we are donating $20 million USD to major Intergovernmental Organizations and local NGOs on the ground to help provide emergency relief to refugees and children to support logistics on the ground such as food, fuel and supplies for refugees in countries bordering with Ukraine and more.

This website was built to help the people of Ukraine and it enable people to donate using crypto.
